# unreal-sous-chef
Helps you manage some of the data for cooking UE4 packages

# Current Features:

* Scan 2 content directories for differences (just filename comparison, nothing binary deep). When working in UE4, your project can get a little bloated with unused files, and scanning your cooked files against your content directory can help you easily determine unused assets.
